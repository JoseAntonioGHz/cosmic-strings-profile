# cosmic-strings-profile
This Python code solves numerically a system of non-linear coupled differential equations to obtain the profile of U(1)_Y' local cosmic strings.

phi = radial part of the higss boson
xi = radial part of the new higgs boson
a = auxiliary function of the U(1)_Y' gauge field 


It is believed that through the so-called Kibble mechanism topological defects could have formed in the early universe. We discuss a model
beyond the Standard Model that permits a type of topological defects called cosmic strings. 

In order to study cosmic string solutions, we first promote the global symmetry U(1)Bâˆ’L to a local symmetry and add a new gauge coupling. 

The cancellation of gauge anomalies is achieved by adding a right-handed neutrino to each lepton generation. 

Moreover, a new Higgs field is added in order to give mass to the right-handed neutrino. 

Finally, we study the field equations of motion of the two Higgs fields and the gauge field, in
order to obtain the profiles of the cosmic strings.
